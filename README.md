# Fully-Convolutional-Networks
 fully convolutional network for segmentation TF2

data from http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html

resized image size to (128,128,3) for convenience. Originally, FCNs are applicable to arbitrary input size.  

epochs: 50, train with label 0 in train_test_split.txt and images shown below are from sets with label 1 in train_test_split.txt
